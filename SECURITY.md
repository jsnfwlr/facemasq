# Security Policy

## Security Updates

As and when vulnerabilities and security issues are discovered/reported, work will be done to mitigate or rectify them.

As this is an free, open-source project, this work will be done in what ever the time the maintainers can spare.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability or security issue in facemasq, please reach out to the maintainer @jsnfwlr on twitter or via email: phalacee@gmail.com to report it.

Provide as much detail as possible about the vulnerability, and if possible, what can be done to mitigate it.

DO NOT submit a pull request until you have discussed the issue with the maintainers.

The maintainers will respond as best they can, and will let you know what will be done to rectify the issue, with an estimated timeline of the process if necessary.
